    <h1>making gpt-2 self-referential</h1>
    <p>We want to explore the underlying Dataset of GPT-2. For this we defined jcpeterson’s webtext as a starting point with 2gb of weblinks. Making GPT-2 self-referential. What does it mean if the dataset is trained on websites?</p>

    <p>How are the visual aesthetics (template culture) of the modern web connected to its textual content? Will we just generate 404 not found pages with cookie warnings and adblock pop-ups?</p>
    <p>Exploring the origins of gpt-2's dataset through a context visualizer, will a reverse search be possible?</p>

      <p>Conrad Weise is currently studying and living in Cologne, Germany. In his work he looks at socio-political settings where he locates computational systems and their implications. His current research is exploring algorithmic biases and the hidden labour in computational systems. While computational systems are often camouflaged as being objective or neutral, the underlying processes are anything but. At the core, software development is about the interpretation of inclusion and exclusion.</p>
