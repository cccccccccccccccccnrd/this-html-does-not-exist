    <!-- <p>We want to explore the underlying Dataset of GPT-2. For this we defined jcpeterson’s webtext as a starting point with 2gb of weblinks. Making GPT-2 self-referential. What does it mean if the dataset is trained on websites?</p> -->
    <p>We attempt to explore the underlying dataset of the GPT-2 language model, which is conditioned on outgoing reddit links – But what does it mean if GPT-2 is trained on webtext? What sort of biases can we find and does it affect the model?
We want to create tools to explore these pages and finally retrain the model to create coherent webpages itself (using full HTML and CSS in training). This self referential system will create short lived websites that "do not exist" to showcase the underlying mechanics of this text generator.

      <p>Matthias Pitscher is a contemporary media artist with a BfA from the Bauhaus University Weimar, currently part of the Interface Cultures department at the University of Art and Design in Linz. His interests range from human-computer hybrids, pseudo-intelligent machines, to the creation and analysis of unnecessary datasets. Sometimes using consumerist aesthetics to create absurd products or practices, other times transforming ordinary content into contemplative sculptures and websites.</p>

      <h1>cnrd</h1>
      <p>Conrad Weise is currently studying and living in Cologne, Germany. In his work he looks at socio-political settings where he locates computational systems and their implications. His current research is exploring algorithmic biases and the hidden labour in computational systems. While computational systems are often camouflaged as being objective or neutral, the underlying processes are anything but. At the core, software development is about the interpretation of inclusion and exclusion.</p>
